        <![CDATA[
        Care pathways are used as logical groupings for clinical protocols defined in the <a ui-sref="santedb-admin.cdr.cdss.dashboard"><strong>CDSS Library</strong></a>. A care pathway 
        allows patients to be "enrolled" (either automatically or manually). Once enrolled, a <strong>Care Plan</strong> is created based on the CDSS rules configured. This allows SanteEMR
        plugins and programmes to track care against a known best practice and compare with actual care delivery.
